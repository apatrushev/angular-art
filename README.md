# angular-art
ART is Angular-RequireJS template.

Application template designed to quickly start new projects.<br>
For example, small projects created to quickly test something with angular-javascript-html-css.<br>
Definitely not suitable for production (maybe just as starting point).

# Why?
It has only what I need personally. Nothing more. I created it for myself.
